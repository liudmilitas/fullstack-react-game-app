## About

Gashapon Arcade Machine Simulator developed with React, Django and TailwindCSS.

A simple browser game, where users can buy coins and use them to activate a gachapon vending machine in order to obtain a random sticker. Users can register, login, purchase in-game coins and see the stickers they have obtained so far.
 
## Goal and requirements
